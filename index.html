  <p align="justify">Image-guided surgery (IGS) is the use of real-time tracked instruments to match anatomical structures in the operative field with pre- or intra-operative imaging data. Several challenges are involved with IGS systems, such as image registration, respiratory motion, patient positioning, visualization, hand-eye coordination.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the neuroimaging and surgical technologies lab - Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University. My research interests revolve around the use of ultrasound imaging for IGS. Ultrasound imaging is a safe, low cost, fast and non-invasive imaging modality that can be used during IGS to establish instrument-to-image correspondence. My work involves the development of IGS software for brain and spine interventions with a particular focus on ultrasound-CT/MR image registration, interactive image segmentation, surface and volume reconstruction and augmented ultrasound visualization.
